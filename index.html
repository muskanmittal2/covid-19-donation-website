            <h3>Don't touch Face</h3>
            <p>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you. <br>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Never touch your face with dirty hands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands if soap and water are not available.
                </li>

            <p>If you are wearing a mask: You can cough or sneeze into your mask. Put on a new, clean mask as soon as possible and wash your hands. <br>
            If you are not wearing a mask:
            </p>
            <ul>

            <h3>Wear a Mask</h3>
            <p>If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places. <br>
            In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings. <br>
            In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings and for activities with close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated. <br>
            If you are fully vaccinated and have a condition or are taking medications that weaken your immune system, you may need to keep taking steps to protect yourself, like wearing a mask. Talk to your healthcare provider about steps you can take to manage your health and risks. <br>
            If you are fully vaccinated, see When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated.
